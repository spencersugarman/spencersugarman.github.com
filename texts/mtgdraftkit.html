		<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
		
		<p>Full disclosure: I am a nerd and a geek. As a nerd, I play Magic the Gathering, a collectible trading card game. In general, the game involves two players constructing a deck, then battling against each other. About once a week, friends and I get together for a Magic tournament, and are often annoyed by the sometimes annoying pen-and-paper math which goes into deciding who gets to play who each round. As a group of geeks, we decided there has to be a better way.</p>
		
		<h2>THE GOAL</h2>
		
		<p>While there are many things which could be computerized, I am currently focusing on developing a web app for managing the running of a tournament. This includes registering players, tracking wins and losses, and pairing players for each round. The ability for the application to work on any smartphone is crucial, as the app should be available no matter which of us happen to be free to play. </p>
		
		<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
		
		<p>To accomplish this, I am implementing the official Magic the Gathering pairing algorithm in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and designing the user interface using <strong>jQuery Mobile and HTML5/CSS</strong>. A very very very very very rough proof-of-concept, desktop-optimized version is <a href="http://mtgdraftkit.com/mxyzptlk/">hiding on mtgdraftkit.com</a>, which I will be updating as the design becomes more mobile friendly. </p>
