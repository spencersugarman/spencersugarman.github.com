		<p>HiFive is a <strong>mobile application</strong> for finding interesting people, sessions, and opportunities at conferences. Combining social networking and location awareness, <strong>HiFive helps the right people meet each other</strong> in a fun and adventurous way. Though never implemented, the application was designed in great detail for a graduate level course at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

		<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

		<p>Leveraging the capabilities of online social networking "in real life" had yet to be properly addressed. A few businesses have entered this broad space, but most social networking exists virtually and without regard to users' location or activities. Furthermore, the most mature social networking services primarily focus on connections between people you know instead of people with whom a valuable connection might be made. A mobile service addressing the latter could <strong>support these new connections</strong> in a convenient way, and even create value for the space in which these connections are born. To fill this gap, our group set out to develop a service which encourages people in shared physical spaces to <strong>engage in meaningful experiences</strong> with each other through interacting with their mobile devices.</p>

		<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

		<p>The first phase of user research was purposefully broad, investigating the focus of "understanding why people talk with people they don't know" while finding out what makes those interactions meaningful. For this purpose, we conducted <strong>five interviews:</strong> four with current students and one with a professional working in the information technology field. We employed a method of <strong>retrospective story elicitation</strong> where interviewees were asked to recount recent experiences that were relevant to the focus of our investigation.</p>

		<p>Our insights from these interviews suggested finding a common group or venue where strangers are prone to have meaningful interactions. We then identified professional conferences and meetings as an appropriate venue to target a possible service, as attendees would necessarily share a pool of common interests and goals. Moreover, it was hypothesized that these events would necessarily those specifically searching for networking opportunities with others that they haven't previously met. The second phase of user research was focused on "understanding how people meet and engage interesting contacts at conferences." To this end, <strong>we conducted eight further retrospective interviews</strong> with conference attendees in professions ranging from IT to law, and two event organizers with experience organizing campus events for students.</p>

		<p>After the second research phase, our findings boiled down to three main insights:</p>
		
		<ul class="block-list col3">
			<li>
				<h3>01.</h3>
				People need an easy way to find interesting people at conferences and large events. This requires identification of interests and goals of attendees beforehand, and real-time awareness of attendee location during the event. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>02.</h3>
				Attendees collaborating benefits not only the attendees themselves, but also their employers and the event organizers. 
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>03.</h3>
				Event organizers gain a wealth of value by being able to follow the successes and breakdowns of attendees as an event progresses.
			</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

		<p><img src="assets/imgs/hi5/hi5-iphone.jpg"></p>

		<p>At this point, my team knew we wanted to design a service that helps people at conferences make meaningful connections with the most interesting people around them during and after the conference. In the usual design course, the next steps would include low-fidelity prototyping and the like, but this course revolved around <strong>the business end of design</strong>. At a high level, we examined the value-revenue flows of two alternative services. After settling exactly how the stakeholders would interact with each other, we created narratives describing various use cases. These provided the stories from which to construct our <strong>service blueprint</strong>, which in turn allowed us to detail the technical and financial feasibility of the app.</p> 

		<p>To calculate financial viability, we estimated running costs (bandwidth, office space, etc.) in comparison to projected revnue (number of users per month, sponsors per conference, etc.). We envisioned premium licensing for large conferences (e.g., building the IxDA app on top of the HiFive framework), and predicted that only a small fraction of those conferences were needed for HiFive to reach profitability.</p>
