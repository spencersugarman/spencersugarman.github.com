		<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

		<p>Surprisingly, it is not the shallow waters or deepest depths of the ocean that is most mysterious to oceanographers, but the bit in the middle. To investigate this area, and especially coral reefs, the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Department has developed ReefBot, a remote-controlled submersible for automatically cataloguing the many species native to coral reefs. In order to gather pilot data, the robotics department teamed up with the Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium to deploy <strong>a fun exhibit</strong> in which children can test the robot. Simply, the exhibit would involve children controlling the robot and capturing and identifying photos of fish in a large tank at the aquarium. This would allow the robotics team to quickly increase the accuracy of their machine-learning algorithms, but is a somewhat complex process for a child. My team was brought on to the project toward the end, and was tasked with <strong>designing a usable, kid-friendly interface</strong> for the exhibit. </p>

		<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

		<p>My team had two main goals in designing this exhibit. We worked to design an interface <strong>intuitive enough to walk up and use</strong> without any training. The exhibit would also <strong>see upwards of hundreds of visitors a day</strong>, so it needed to provide an entertaining experience in a minimal amount of time.</p>

		<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

		<p>With less than two months for research, ideation, and design, my team worked quickly to understand the goals of zoo visitors and how these goals were currently being met. We met with zoo officials to tour the zoo and aquarium, then <strong>shadowed three families</strong> as the explored the zoo. This highlighted the kinds of information available to zoo patrons, and which subsections of that information was most engaging to children and their parents.</p>

		<p>My team also <strong>spent time observing the space</strong> within which the exhibit would exist in order to get a sense of the physical limitations when designing an interface which would (if all went well) provide a large attraction. Between our observations and interviews, we had a flood of data to manage. To help organize our thoughts and gain a complete understanding, we synthesized our findings into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contextual_design">cultural, artifact, physical, and flow models</a>.</p>

		<p>After a short immersion in the problem space, we spent the rest of our weeks designing and testing the interface. We started by investigating arcade games and similar exhibits at other zoos and museums. We <strong>paper prototyped a handful of ideas</strong> before settling on the idea of framing the exhibit as a competitive game. Players would have 90 seconds to capture as many photos as they could, after which they would review the photos to identify the fish within. However, from previous observations, we realized the game would also need a "free swim" mode. The fast-paced competition would be suitable for when many children crowded the exhibit, but during quiet times (like midweek at 10am) having to stop every 90 seconds could be frustrating for a child. </p>
		
		<p>In addition to user testing with <strong>think-alouds</strong>, we also performed <strong>heuristic evaluations</strong> and used <a href="http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/">CogTool</a> to test our interface. These methods provided strong evidence to <strong>guide and support our design decisions</strong>. </p>
