			<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>

			<p>Thanks to the ubiquitousness of touchscreens, there has been a large push toward developing more <strong>natural user interfaces</strong>. So-called NUIs find strength in intuitive interactions through direct manipulation and gesture. Consumer products have adopted this new design practice, but many markets remain underserved. 3M wanted to discover new possibilities for leveraging their extensive industrial skills in one such market: education. After an initial round of research and much discussion with the client, we narrowed the focus of the project to building a forward-looking interactive solution for kindergarten-through-4th-grade students and teachers that facilitates small-group learning.</p>

			<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

			<p>My team and I worked with 3M for eight months to understand the education space and design a prototype fit for the classroom of the future. We took a <strong>data-driven approach</strong> to design that accomodate users and grounds the design process in information about their needs, goals, and attitudes. To start, we spent four months researching small-group learning in theory and practice, before using the remaining months to <strong>iteratively design a tangible prototype</strong> of our solution.</p>

			<h2>GETTING OUR FEET WET</h2>

			<p>Our first order of business was immersing ourselves in the space. In parallel with a <strong>competitive analysis</strong> of six existing products, we performed a <strong>literature review</strong> of over 100 academic papers to gain an understanding of small-group learning and the theories and considerations behind current educational technologies. After reviewing the literature, we summarized our insights in four key areas:</p>

			<ul class="block-list col4">
				<li>
					<h3>Interface Considerations</h3>
					Research has identified specific considerations that should be taken into account when designing educational systems for children. Both the physical and mental capabilites of children can be markedly different than adults depending on their age. For instance, kindergarteners and first graders in the preoperational stage of development can only hold a single item in memory at a time, and most kids have a difficult time with "simple" actions like marquee selection, double-clicking, and drag-and-drop.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Content Presentation</h3>
					Information deluge decreases a learner's ability for recall. Since information can be stored in short-term memory based on aural or visual characteristics, presenting both pictoral and verbal representations of information leads to stronger mental representations and consequently better learning. However, research has also shown that too much concurrent information can split attention, greatly inhibiting learning. Modularizing learning activities allows the student to focus on one task at a time.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Content Development</h3>
					Technology allows for greater levels of interactivity and new kinds of explorative behavior, enabling novel and effective educational instruction. Studies have shown that framing educational content within the challenging, open environment of a game can increase students' motivation and their desire to learn. Games help scaffold learning, allowing the student to learn how to find the answer rather than just learning what the answer is. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Kid-driven Design</h3>
					Exploring the learning needs of children requires modifying research methods used in other contexts. Usual methods such as video recording are often untenable in public schools and museums without a lot of prior outreach to parents and caretakers. In addition to legal issues, some methods can be difficult or provide inaccurate data. Engagement is key here, as children can quickly become uncooperative when confronted with authority or downtime. Creative methods which treat the children as design partners can succeed where more sophisticated tasks fail.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>DIVING IN</h2>

			<p>The bulk of the research phase was spent investigating small-group learning inside actual classrooms and children's museums. In total, we visited eighteen classrooms across kindergarten to sixth grade, and three museums. In these environments we conducted <strong>observational studies</strong> of small-group learning in practice, <strong>contextual interviews and artifact walkthroughs</strong> with teachers, and dispersed <strong>self-reporting kits</strong> to track actions outside of our observations. Based on our results, we crafted three <strong>personas</strong> to describe the main players involved in small-group learning, and outlined four guidelines for designing our final solution:</p>

			<ul class="block-list col4">
				<li>
					<h3>Educational Ecosystem</h3>
					School systems are just that: systems. There are a number of moving parts that must be accounted for when introducing a new product into the space.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Group Dynamics</h3>
					Small group learning takes place in a variety of contexts, and teachers structure groups in different ways to achieve social and educational goals.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Customized Content</h3>
					Classroom technologies should enable teachers to customize content and help them cater to the needs of each individual student.
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Captivating Interactions</h3>
					Today's technologies have the potential to provide students with engaging, exploratory learning experiences in a way that has never been possible.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

			<p>We spent the summer ideating and refining the overall design and iteratively developing a high fidelity prototype. We worked with 3M to provide various design ideas grounded in our research findings and choosing the one that most fit the need. We went through the process of ideation from May through June and followed up with concept validation to narrow down our ideas. We also communicated with research participants, and provided them with <strong>low-fidelity prototypes to get quick feedback</strong>. Once the direction had been set, we iteratively designed and tested <strong>several hardware and software prototypes</strong>.</p>

			<p>As part of the iterative design process, the usability-testing phase began in July. We user-tested our product in classrooms to see how it fit into the environment. In the end, we provided 3M with pixel-perfect mockups of the software interface, a Flash demo of the hardware capabilities, a medium-fidelity prototype of the hardware design, and a video showing (with some computer trickery) our solution in action.</p>

			<p>Since the results of our design are covered by a non-disclosure agreement, I am unable to reveal any more details for this project.</p>
