		<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
		
		<p>The formats of the majority of psychology experiments are surprisingly similar: participant views a stimulus, participant responds, rinse and repeat. Yet, the tools for creating and running psychology experiments are notoriously difficult to use. Applications like ePrime, Presentation, and Matlab offer an amazing level of control, but as hinted above, most experiments do not require this much power. Furthermore, the available applications are also notoriously platform-dependent because of legacy decisions.</p>
		
		<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

		<p>Disrupting the current state of the art necessitates a simple, easy to use application which can fulfill the needs of 80% of psychology researchers. In this setting, "easy to use" refers to more than just the user interface, and also requires the application be easy to obtain and run. To this end, my partner and I decided to push forward with a cross-platform web solution. Our hope is that leveraging such ubiquitous technology will allow for the product to reach a wider audience of both researchers and participants.</p>

		<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
		
		<p>My partner and I are concurrently designing a first iteration of the application while conducting cognitive walkthroughs of existing tools with researchers in the Pittsburgh area. The experiment creator is being designed entirely in JavaScript using the Dojo toolkit. We are investigating whether the experiment "player" can also be created in JavaScript, or if timing issues are too problematic. Many researchers believe they need a more accurate measure of reaction time than current implementations of JavaScript are capable of, but the jury is still out. Either way, we are also creating an open, XML format for describing the experiments to enable third-party developers to write their own creators and players if desired.</p>
