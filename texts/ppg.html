		<h2>END OF AN ERA</h2>

		<p>The last decade has seen massive disruptions in the newspaper industry. With readers and revenue declining by the day, newspapers have been forced to explore <strong>new ways to remain relevant</strong>. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, a local major newspaper, presented this design challenge to Carnege Mellon University in 2009 at the height of the industry's downward spiral. </p>

		<h2>DESIGN TO THE RESCUE</h2>

		<p>A series of <strong>affinity diagramming</strong> sessions enabled us to develop a <strong>territory map</strong> describing the current news landscape. We identified People, Media, and News Organizations as the three main landmarks, and decided on the intersection of all three as the focus of the project. To this end, we used the following <strong>hunt statement</strong> as our guiding light: "We hope to cultivate a deeper connection between the community and the news organization by leveraging the personal attachment between readers and the media they consume." Vague, but just specific enough to keep us on track for the remainder of the semester.</p>
		

		<h2>THE PROCESS</h2>

		<p>Moving forward required understanding the current state of things from the perspective of the news creators and the news consumers. To understand the former, we toured the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette offices and spoke with representatives from each department. We performed <strong>an extensive literature review</strong> to clarify the history and current financial state of the industry as a whole and the Post-Gazette in particular. <a href="http://findingthenews.tumblr.com/">A Tumblr blog</a> was also setup to track the changing landscape and provide a dumping ground for cutting-edge ideas.</p>

		<p>To understand the role the Post-Gazette, other newspapers, and "news" in general played in the lives of Pittsburgh residents, my team and I conducted some <strong>guerilla user research</strong>. We did "man on the street" interviews with people in various neighborhoods and utilized <strong>make tools</strong> to probe residents' feelings on authenticity and relevance. </p>

		<p><strong>Our research revealed important insights</strong> about the expectations news consumers have of their media. Most importantly, readers want their news to be relevant. For this reason, it became apparent that people who love the city read about the city (<em>surprise!</em>). We decided that growing this population would be key to the Post-Gazette maintaining readership into the future no matter the form the newspaper would take. After synthesizing the information we discovered, we decided to focus our efforts on the city's large transient population. The area's colleges and cheap cost of living attract many people, but only for a short time. </p>

		<p>During ideation, we realized the crucial bit separating those in love with Pittsburgh from those who could care less was a sense of belonging. The Post-Gazette is <strong>in a prime position to nurture connectivity</strong> to the city by virtue of its position as a central hub of local information.</p> 
		
		<h2>THE SOLUTION</h2>

		<p>Our final solution drew heavily on what Shelley Evenson and Hugh Dubberly described as <strong>the experience cycle:</strong> compel, orient, embed, generate, reverberate. They stated a good product or service experience "captures the user's imagination, helps users navigate the product, becomes parts of the users' lives, grows as users' skills increase, and delights so much that users tell other people about it." With this in mind, we designed an end-to-end service for turning Pittsburgh's temporary residents into true citizens...and readers.</p>

		<h3>The Burgh:</h3>

		<p>Transplants are inherently ignorant of the news, events, and so on in Pittsburgh, and thus would have no knowledge of even where to find those offerings. We realized the unparalleled discoverability of print coupled with the Post-Gazette's competency with distribution would provide the perfect avenue for introducing transplants to our service. Thus was born The Burgh, a weekly print publication designed to foster familiarity with Pittsburgh and highlight the offerings available in its many neighborhoods. Importantly, much of this information was already avaiable in the Post-Gazette, but repackaging it in a different venue would enable a new, broader audience to find it.</p>

		<h3>postgazette.com</h3>

		<p>Formerly imagined as an independent section in the website, we started from the ground up and devised an entire redesign of postgazette.com. We proposed to have every news article, event listing, and classified advertisement geotagged and placed behind an interactive map interface. Stories would be filterable by a number of categories (e.g., breaking news, sports, movies, etc.), and could always be presented within their geographic context. More than just showing the official boundaries between neighborhoods, the map would highlight the Pittsburgh areas that have grown organically out of citizens' actions. </p>

		<p>The website itself would also become organic, allowing readers to track, edit, and submit events happening around the city. As a user-editable hub of everything Pittsburgh, The Post-Gazette would be in a unique position to follow the reader through his or her entire journey, from discovering an event to attending the event to sharing the experience with others. Whether this was as simple as providing bus route information or enabling the reader to upload photographs, postgazette.com would become a new venue through which readers could participate in Pittsburgh. The deep connections postgazette.com could foster pushed our service to its fullest, finally enabling it to cover all stages of the experience cycle.</p>
