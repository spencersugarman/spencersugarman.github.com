		<h2>THE PROBLEM</h2>
		
		<p>Each year the New York City government produces thousands of pages of information in an aggregated, unusable form that prevents vital public scrutiny and handicaps advocates and communities in their quest to respond to pressing social problems. New Yorkers deserve better. Reliable and timely data can ensure the best possible results. Right now, too much of New York City's data is neither.</p>
		
		<h2>THE GOAL</h2>

		<p>With data transparency, New Yorkers would be able to evaluate what works and what doesn't objectively. Not-for-profits, and the associated donors, would be able to judge community needs more comprehensively, and to respond with the same insight that NYC government can bring to the issues. Citizens and organizations would be able to use that knowledge to make smarter policy and political choices. openNYC seeks to promote good governance in New York City by the public with comprehensive data that can be read and understood with ease.</p>

		<p>openNYC exists as part of <a href="http://openingdata.org">Opening Data</a>, a larger not-for-profit organization that aims to use data science to support cities, states, school districts, and other civic enterprises. Opening Data hopes to allow citizens and governments to better understand and address social problems by providing open data, engaging communities, developing tools for analyzing and presenting results, and offering assistance to groups interested in utilizing civic data.</p>
