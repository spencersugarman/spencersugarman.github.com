		<h2>HIDDEN LANGUAGE</h2>
		
		<p>Carnegie Mellon University is home to <a href="http://talkbank.org"><strong>TalkBank</strong></a>, a system for sharing and studying research in human and animal communication. <strong>Over 40,000 transcripts</strong> have been collected thus far, each converted to a standard CHAT text format. Until recently, these transcripts and the tools created to analyze them had to be used offline. This is fine for researchers incorporating the data into their projects, but a high barrier to entry for educators and others with only a temporary need for the data.</p>
		
		<h2>DATA AT OUR FINGERTIPS</h2>
		
		<p>To aid in helping anyone around the world gain access to the data, I created an online viewer. The site uses <strong>PHP</strong> to parse the CHAT transcripts on demand, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to control media playback from a <strong>Darwin Streaming Server</strong> and sync the transcript with associated media. Researchers can open any transcript, watch related media, and perform analyses all in the browser. A local version has also been deployed at the University of Southern Denmark for their specific language and corpura needs.</p>
		
		<p>As with most projects in academia, the TalkBank transcript browser is ever-evolving. At the moment, I am working to implement line-by-line comments so researchers can collaboratively annotate transcripts. These comments are a complicated addition since transcripts are more living documents than static archives; changes in coding schemes, file metadata, or a dozen other alterations can cause lines to be shifted, merged, or removed altogether. This makes linking a comment to a specific line especially complex.</p>
